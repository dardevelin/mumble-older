This file documents the commit message fix that was applied.

The following commits were rewritten to use UPPERCASE type names:
- "feat(webrtc)" -> "FEAT(webrtc)"
- "docs(webrtc)" -> "DOCS(webrtc)" 
- "chore:" -> "MAINT:"
- "Initial plan" was removed (empty commit)

All commits now pass the commit style check.
